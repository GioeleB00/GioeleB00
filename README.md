# Hi there 👋

I’m **Gioele Botta** — ex theoretical physicist turned developer, passionate about  
**distributed systems**, **performance modeling**, and **open-source software**.

🔭 Currently building **[AsyncFlow](https://github.com/AsyncFlow-Sim/AsyncFlow)** ⚡  
A scenario-driven simulator to explore scalability, reliability, and trade-offs in modern distributed systems.  
Featured in *Python Weekly* and discussed by SRE leaders — AsyncFlow is my main open-source focus.
