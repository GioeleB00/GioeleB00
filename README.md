# üëã Hi there!

I‚Äôm **Gioele Botta** ex theoretical physicist turned developer.  
Passionate about **distributed systems**, **performance modeling**, and **open-source software**.

##  AsyncFlow  

[**AsyncFlow**](https://github.com/AsyncFlow-Sim/AsyncFlow) is my main open-source focus:  
a scenario-driven simulator to explore scalability, reliability, and trade-offs in modern distributed systems.  

Featured in *Python Weekly* and shared on X from *PythonHub*.
